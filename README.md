### Hi there 👋
I'm Giancarlo Garica.
💻 I'm a Computer Science major at California State University Stanislaus. I am a Program Manager for Mobile Android Development at my University. 🏫 


🔭 I am a Software Engineering Intern JPMorgan Chase & Co. and a dedicated developer within my team. I've been working my software development and mobile development skills through Codepath courses, projects, hackathons, and volunteering initiatives. You can check most of these out in my repositories, although some not, those darn NDAs. 😪

💬 Feel free to talk to me about paving the way for new intersection of technology with education, society, and sustainability.
